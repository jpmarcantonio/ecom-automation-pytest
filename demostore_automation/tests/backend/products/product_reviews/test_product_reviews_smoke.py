        Test case to verify that the create product review endpoint successfully creates product review.

         Steps:
        1. Create a product for the test using GenericProductsHelper.
        2. Generate a random review for the product, including reviewer details and a rating.
        3. Use GenericProductsReviewsHelper to create a review for the product via the API.
        4. Verify the response to ensure the correct product ID, review, rating, reviewer name, reviewer email, and status are returned.
        5. Repeat the above steps to create multiple reviews for the same product.
        6. Retrieve product information via the API to verify that the review count is accurate.
        7. Due to a known bug (Jira SSQA-123 and FC-7) where the actual rating count shows 1 less than expected, adjust the expected count accordingly.
           (Remove this adjustment when the bug is resolved.)
        8. (To-do) Implement updated review count verification when bug is resolved.
        9. (To-do) Use the 'list reviews' endpoint to get all reviews for the given product and verify the product has the expected reviews.
       10. (To-do) Verify that the reviews created are correctly attached to the product using database verification.
